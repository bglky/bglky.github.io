## Quick Start

### Environment

If you have jekyll installed, simply run `jekyll serve` in Command Line
and preview the themes in your browser. You can use `jekyll serve --watch` to watch for changes in the source files as well.


### Get Started

You can easily get started by modifying `_config.yml`:

```
# Site settings
title: SPA-blog # the title of your blog
SEOTitle: SPA-blog | 单页-响应式-博客 # the SEOTitle of your blog
email: bglky.me@gmail.com # your email
keywords: "周炳光的博客,bglky blog,周炳光,bglky,responsive,blog,framework7,jekyll" # the keywords of your blog
description: "An awesome SPA and responsive blog based on Framework7 and Jekyll!" # the description of your blog
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://bglky.me" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
...

```

There are more options you can check out in the [Jekyll - Official Site](http://jekyllrb.com/), or you can directly dive into code to find more.
